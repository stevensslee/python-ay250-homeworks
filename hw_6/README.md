## Homework 6
[Homework 6](https://github.com/stevensslee/python-ay250-homeworks/blob/main/hw_6/hw6_ml.ipynb) was completed on Apr. 5, 2022.


Problem 1:
I randomly added convolutional, pooling, and dense layers together to create a network for the first part of the problem. Suprisingly, it did not train whatsoever. I also copied the network from the tensorflow tutorial here https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification, which also didn't train. Will investigate this problem in the future.

Problem 2:
I also copy-and-pasted the simple random forest classifier from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html, which also didn't train! Both the neural networks and random forest will be tuned, if time permits, for better results.
